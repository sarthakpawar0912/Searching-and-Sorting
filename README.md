DSA-Searching-Sorting 🚀

Project Overview 📚

This repository contains Java implementations of searching and sorting algorithms for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) study. Clear, documented code is organized for learning and reuse. 🌟

Algorithms Implemented 🛠️

Sorting Algorithms





Insertion Sort (sorting.insertion.InsertionSort):





Builds sorted array one element at a time, in-place.



Time: O(n²) worst/average, O(n) best.



Space: O(1).



Merge Sort (sorting.merge.MergeSort):





Divides array, sorts halves, merges back.



Time: O(n log n) all cases.



Space: O(n).



Quick Sort (sorting.quick.QuickSort):





Partitions around pivot, sorts recursively.



Time: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst.



Space: O(log n) average.

Searching Algorithms





Linear Search (searching.linear.LinearSearch):





Checks each element sequentially.



Time: O(n).



Space: O(1).



Binary Search (searching.binary.BinarySearch):





Searches sorted array by halving interval.



Time: O(log n).



Space: O(1).
